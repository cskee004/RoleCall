# RoleCall

RoleCall is a cross-platform application designed to help players and Game Masters (GMs) organize and find tabletop role-playing games (TTRPGs). The platform matches users based on game preferences, schedules, and locations but does not facilitate online play sessions. It includes features such as player and GM profiles, and automated match algorithm.

## My Contributions

### Backend
- Designed and implemented Docker containers for the MySQL database and Flask server.
- Created a Docker README with instructions for building the containers, configuring them, and testing their communication.

### Frontend
- Designed and implemented the Create Listing interface, enabling the matching algorithm to find potential matches for users.
- Debugged the listing interface, tracing issues from Android Studio through the tech stack down to Flask and the MySQL database.

### DevOps and Deployment
- Managed API documentation and version control using GitHub.
- Authored the user manual for the Create Listing interface.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Java
- **Backend:** Flask (Python), MySQL
